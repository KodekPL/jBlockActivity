jBlockActivity 0.9.4
==============

My idea of better and simpler LogBlock!

* Requires Bukkit build 3074 or higher (Spigot build 1449 or higher).
* Requires WorldEdit build 3282 or higher to support logging of it.

## TODO: 
* Add aliases to materials for easier usage of commands
* Make saving using new Minecraft ID system with backward compatibility
